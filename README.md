# ansible-jsonpatch
An Ansible module for patching JSON files

## Description
This Ansible module follows [RFC 6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) for JSON notation and [RFC 6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) for JSON patching.

In addition to the standard, there is an extra notation feature not outlined in RFC 6901: you can specify *every* member of an array with a `*` character in the path.

## Installation
In order to make use of this module, download the [json_patch.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ParticleDecay/ansible-jsonpatch/master/json_patch.py) file to the `library` directory in the root of your Ansible project:
```
myproject/
├── ansible.cfg
├── inv/
├── library/
│   ├── json_patch.py
├── playbooks/
├── roles/
```

Make sure that the directory is pointed to in the `ansible.cfg`:

```ini
[defaults]
library = ./library
```

## Usage
The module `json_patch` takes the following options:

| Name    | Description     | Choices |
| ------- | --------------- | ------- |
| `src` | The path to a file containing JSON | |
| `dest` | The path to an optional output file to write the patched JSON (default is to overwrite `src` file) | |
| `operations` | A list of valid operations to perform against the given JSON file | See [RFC 6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902#section-4) |
| `backup` | Backup the JSON file (the one that will be overwritten) before editing (default: `no`) | `yes`/`no` |
| `unsafe_writes` | Allow Ansible to fall back to unsafe (i.e. non-atomic) methods of writing files (default: `no`) | `yes`/`no` |
| `pretty` | Write JSON output in human-readable format | `yes`/`no` |
| `create` | Create file if it does not exist | `yes`/`no` |
| `create_type` | Type of JSON structure to create if empty (default: `object`) | `object`/`array` |

#### Operations
Operations may consist of two or more of the following properties:

| Name | Required | Value |
| ---- | -------- | ----- |
| `op` | yes | one of `add`, `remove`, `replace`, `move`, `copy`, or `test` |
| `path` | yes | RFC 6901 JSON notation |
| `from` | no | RFC 6901 JSON notation (only applies to `move` and `copy`)|
| `value` | no | any valid JSON value |

#### Special Notations
There are two special notations:
  - The `-` character refers to the *end* of an array (for appending a non-existent value)
  - (non-RFC 6901 compliant) The `*` character may refer to *every* member of an array (for testing each member)

## Examples

## Testing
Testing is simple if you have pytest installed:
```bash
pytest
```
Note you may have to copy the `json_patch.py` file into your Ansible installation's `lib/ansible/modules/files/` dir.

## Contributing
PRs welcome! Just make sure you update tests as well.

Current needs:
- Special character handling ([RFC 6901 - Syntax](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901#section-3))
- Applying `*` support to other operations:
  - `add` should affect every member of an array
  - `remove` should remove the path from each member of an array
  - `replace` should replace for each member of an array
